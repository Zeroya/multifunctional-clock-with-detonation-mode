Hi, this is my diploma project.

if you need to run a simulation, it's best to use proteus, and files from the proteus_prim folder, there are 3 simulations in different interpretations.
the working_prototype folder contains all the main files for running the device and firmware.
PDF documents mainly contain a device diagram, the principle of operation and diagrams for printing a diagram.
in a Word document, my explanatory note, written in Ukrainian. 
If you have any questions feel free to contact)
